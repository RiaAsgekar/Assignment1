# Expression Evaluation Using Stack
In this assignment, we are evaluating the time taken for infix and postfix notations to evaluate mathematical expressions. We are evaluating infix expressions against their converted postfix counterparts. 
Stack is the data structure chosen because it works best with the nature of mathematical expressions and the requirement to maintain the order of operations and handling parentheses.
